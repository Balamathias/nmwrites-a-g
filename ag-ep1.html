      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode One</h2>
      <p>It was the middle of summer that I first opened my eyes to behold the new world I had appeared in and the applauding hands that rejoiced over my coming.</p>

       <p>I could recall the surrounding mysteries of my birth that led to my tender exposure to the cruel fate of nature.</p>

       <p>Many said I was born with a tooth, unlike other children in my little and tender community.</p>

       <p>I emerged from a system that held some supernatural beliefs about the birth of Children.</p>

       <p>Children whose birth were as mysterious as mine were either executed or abandoned in the forest that the little village had lost renowned hunters to.</p>

      <p>To add to the pack, I also had natural blue eyes! This aroused suspicion among the community leaders who held the customs and traditions of my culture.</p>

     <p>Rather than lament over what had ensued, my parents were rather happy as they saw me to be a unique child.</p>

    <p>After about eleven days of my birth, I could speak! I could pronounce words rather than cry.</p>

    <p>This event turned the whole world against me! It had never happened before in the entire community and the spread out regions!</p>

    <p>"That boy must be cursed!" One of the elders exclaimed. </p>

    <p>"He will surely bring badluck to the community if he is not given to the "evil forest". Another suggested.</p>

    <p>The rest of the leaders took counsel and drew a conclusion that I should be abandoned in the evil forest.</p>

    <p>I was only eleven days old!</p>

    <p>When it was the following day, my Parents were summoned by the leaders of the community. The resolution of the council was laid affront them.</p>

    <p>In my culture, one dare not reject the resolution of the council as it was believed to have emerged from experienced traditionalists.</p>

    <p>"The child must not spend more than two weeks in the land!" One of the elders stressed.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" The rest chorused.</p>

    <p>The community Chief was pleased with the council's resolution. He presided over the matter and rendered his judgement in their favour.</p>

    <p>My parents were dumbfounded, unable to utter their exercisable freedom.</p>

    <p>Since it was already the twelfth day, I was due to be sent to the woods.<p>

    <p>I was seized from my own Parents by some mighty men of valor on the order of the council, cuddled and saddled like a horse up to the woods.</p>

    <p>I was left all alone, wrapped in the very first linen that touched my body.</p>

    <p>In my innocence, I smiled to the butterflies that hovered over my head.</p>

    <p>I could enjoy the melodious sweetness of the tunes of the singing birds. The breeze that led the dry leaves brushed over me and made a companion the dry leaves to my tiny home.</p>

    <p>I was left to the view of the forest trees, a baby to crave for life at such a tender age! </p>
