      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 5</h2>
      <p>Nights were becoming more dreadful and risky for me.

         Although, I had adapted a bit to the environment but hardly did a day pass by that I did never had a bad time.
        </p>

    <p>I developed a feeling that there was something better out there!

     At least, I could smell technology a bit. I had to live to fulfill my aspirations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understood my home, I was moved to make a new move.

      I could barely sum up how old I had become, maybe ten or thereabout.
    </p>

    <p>________</p>

   <p>I drew my plan and concluded on taking my leave for the towns the following day.

     I sat all night thinking and reminiscing about those forest moments, how I ate trees to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could see the stars glaring and promising hope, I saw for the last time in the woods the sun set.

        To my humble birds, we sang our final lyrics.

        Morning came by quickly, I could see myself being groomed together to commence a life search journey.
    </p>

     <p>
       I trekked a few miles and had the feeling that I was either going denser or maybe worse.

      Although quite nervous about any beastly encounter, I walked stealthily.

      In order to increase the precision of my journey, I traced the position of the sun by and by.
     </p>

<small>_____</small>

     <p>
       After a few more miles, I was welcomed by a civilization that lacked quietness as opposed to mine.

       And a flash through my mind recalled the moments of buzzing flies and chirping birds.  Well, I was seeing a total opposite.
     </p>

    <p>I  made myself comfortable on an extremely low cliff by the tarred road.

      After taking a few moments of relaxation, I watched some funny scenes on display... How two tired wheels moved from place to place with people without slipping off.
      </p>

     <p>
       I wondered to some extent how possible that was...

      At this point, it was getting darker and I felt a rumble and a thunderstorm in my stomach.

      I yawned extending my jaws for a few more seconds more than normal.
     </p>

    <p>
      The realities of the streets had just been laid affront me by fate to conquer!

      ...Yes! I slept on empty stomach and no one cared about anybody...
At this point, I missed where I was coming from.
    </p>
