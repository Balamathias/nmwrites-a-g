      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 8</h2>
      <pre class="story-content">
After flipping through the pages of the Bible, I felt overwhelmed by the content of the book.

Although I was never thought how to read, I never knew how to even do so. I could only imagine the letters of the book with what I could actually speak.

' I asked for Mr. God and she gave me this...', I thought.

'what does she want me to do with it? ', I questioned.

After I was unable to figure out what to do, my attention was captured by the sight of some kids going to school.

They reminded me of how uniform the trees were in the forest.

They looked like the ants I saw marching around in uniform.

While I thought about all these, the young woman that had mystified Mr. God to me appeared.

... butterflies in my belly when I saw her.

"Hi, " she grinned.

"Hi..."

"Um... I'm really sorry, I left without a word, I didn't know what to say yesterday but I went to seek Mr. God as you requested to know what to say. "

She spoke intelligently, like one from my race...

Although she rose more questions in my heart when she said she had to seek Mr. God.

' Who is he? Why can't I see him myself? ', I thought.

She then picked from my mind and said...

" Everyone can see him..."

I was shocked! She knew exactly what was bordering me at the time.

" He is everywhere..."
She added.

"Everywhere?"
"How?"
I questioned.

She sat down comfortably beside me and told me the TRUTH!

She told me what I never knew existed.

Overtime, she became really close to me. She told me alot of Bible stories and their morals...

She also guided me on how to go through the Bible she gave me.

She said we could talk to God through what is known as "Prayer..."

" What is your name?", I asked.

"Andrella "
"...and you?"

I told her mine.

I then shared my experiences with her, she consoled me overtime and assured me that God was always with me and would always be.

She assured me of seeing a mother and a father in God.

She then added that if at all I lost anything, God was going to restore it in no time soon.

***

After about two years, Andrella had become a really close friend, although a street hawker like me, she hawked strawberries.

I was now twelve...I sat at my usual location where a lot of customers patronized me more.

I was suddenly captivated by the sight of woman who halted just right in front of me.

She wore dark glasses and a beautiful hat that made her stand out. Her dark jeep shone under the sunlight.

I was at once surprised that the woman walked towards me. She approached me and asked me how I was doing...

" I am fine ma'am, " I replied.

"You look great ma'am..." I admired.

She was surprised, she smiled and thanked me.

" Which one would you love to buy? Pears, Oranges or apples? " I asked pointing the fruits I was hawking.

"You look cute..." She admired pointing my blue eyes.

"Not I alone..." I replied pointing at a two boys some distance away who also had blue eyes.

"Oh..." She sighed.

"The apples..." She suggested.

While I took my time packaging the fruits, I was drawn aback by her question...

"Do you go to school?"

"No!"

"How about your Parents?"

"I don't know..."

"If I ask you to come with me would you?"

...

I gaped at her ...

' why would she want me to come with her? ',
I thought.

" I want to put you through school..."
She suggested.

"I'd love that..."
I said.

"Is that a 'Yes' ?"
She asked to be sure.

I nodded in the affirmative

She smiled...
