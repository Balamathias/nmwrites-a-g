      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 6</h2>
      <p>
        Just as the clouds delayed the emergence of the sun, I was also forced to wake from my nightly sleep by an unceasingly beeping car.

        I was just lucky to have slept just the right duration without turning a side
      </p>

    <p>
      Maybe I would not have been able to defeat the unceasing hunger that had ravaged my stomach scene.

      Just about the same morning, I found my self surrounded by a group of Children staring me like a movie on screen.
    </p>

     <p>
       Well, they might have felt my alien presence, unable to articulate any known language.

       I could not stand the quite embarrassing scene so I left the place craving for food and they kept staring till I got to the bend where I was out of sight.

       My attires couldn't spare their betrayal.
     </p>

    <p>
      I was on the attires I was five years ago!

     After moments of searching, I secured a dump where varieties of fruits had been disposed.

     As a fruit friendly person, I filtered the eatables and left the scene.
    </p>

     <p>
       I could still sight newer spectators staring in awe!

       Well, I was not in anyway shy...

     </p>
     ****

    <p>
      I walked the ailes of the streets and markets like a bat flying at night.

    At some point, I could sight Kids fairly my age struggling to make ends meet.

     I was nonetheless spared by the hunger that had befallen them too.

     I also felt the need to pause at a location and dream dreams.
    </p>

     <p>
       The night caught up with me and I was wrapped up in sleep and till the following morning when the soldiers in my stomach intensified their war.

       At some point, it felt like an aggressive soldier threw a missile at the other but missed the target thereby forcing the missile to land on the walls of my stomach causing so much pain.
     </p>

    <p>I endured it all...</p>
    <p>______</p>

    <p>
      After about few days, I could no longer bear it, I was almost passing out.

     I made series of applications to diverse territories that could hire my tender self to work for them.

     I was plainly denied every offer...

     I kept on feeding on dumps until I could speak like the others fluently.
    </p>

     <p>
       I thought about life, Got myself a new attire from the dump and headed for a sachet water company to relearn life.

       I bought on credit, made sales and returned the integer part of the money to the factory while I spent the rest on food.
     </p>

    <p>
      I felt shelter was not very necessary at the point even though the heavens never spared their tears on me.

      I gave in to sleeping by the corner of stores at night. No atom of fear resided in me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overtime, I was able to make more sales than my counterparts. I wondered why this set of people admired me.

      I thought I was cursed or were they mocking me? All these thoughts flooded my mind but I could restore peace to my humble self at night whenever I watched the stars.Overtime, I was able to make more sales than my counterparts. I wondered why this set of people admired me.

     ...yet people refused to see the inner me and the product of myself!
     </p>

    <p>
      I was a wasting genius waiting to be discovered!
