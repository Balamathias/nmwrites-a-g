      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 3</h2>
    <p>Now I could no longer experience those warm nights and cold mornings with mom!</p>

    <p>Mom was gone for good!</p>

   <p>At some point I got famished. There was nothing to eat!</p>

    <p>At five I developed a feeling of the need to know but my stomach could not spare me to think.</p>

    <p>I gently marched around the forest, examining it's trees.</p>

    <p>After walking a distance from where I had spent the previous night, I could not secure anything that was good for the stomach.</p>

   <p>I walked even farther and farther.

      After walking miles, I clashed with a small stream that streamed down the forest.
    </p>

    <p>I quenched my thirst from the crystal clear water.</p>

    <p>After I had stood up from my knees, I sensed as if someone was behind me, fear gripped me. I turned gently to behold which ever monster was staring.</p>

    <p>To my surprise, I saw a bird feeding from a guava fruit! Although I couldn't conclude whether it was food or not but I sensed that if birds would eat it to survive, I will definitely do too.</p>

    <p>I could not spare a step as I ran to the guava and ate to my satisfaction.</p>

   <p>_______</p>

    <p>At evening I'd be cuddled by the east wind, at night I would weep. At day I would yearn for survival.</p>

    <p>This became my routine every single day in the woods.</p>

    <p>At this point, my bones couldn't stop stretching as the sun set and rose on me.</p>

    <p>Those season of fear had to leave! The trauma of fear was coerced out of my being as days turned months and years.</p>

    <p>Every morning, I'd wake and listen to the melodious voices of those birds that kept me company at day. I was always sad not having them at night.</p>

    <p>I also played around with butterflies. I gave names to birds and insects. Whenever I saw the same insect again, I'd recall it's name.</p>

    <p>Overtime, guava exited it's season, I had to stick to another food supply. I ate foods that were never tagged food.</p>

    <p>At seven, I had already adapted to my new environment. My specialty was none the less hidden.</p>

    <p>I knew at this point the world I was!
       Somehow, The memory of mom was gone.</p>

     <p>I was facing reality, though with dreams.</p>
     <p>I was a wasting genius!!!</p>
