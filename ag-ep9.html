      <pre class="story-content">
        <i>" Why are you helping me ma'am? "</i>
I asked the woman with the dark jeep.

" I - I once lost this opportunity. "
She stuttered as a drop of tear rolled down her cheek.

" I'm very sorry ma'am... ", I sympathized.

"It's okay, I'm fine, come with me." She said as she held me gently on my fist and lifted me on my feet.

She led me to her luxurious jeep, she then opened the door and led me into it.

I was overwhelmed by the small world in her Jeep. She ordered her chauffeur to start the car of which he did.

" Feel comfortable okay... " She informed.

"Thanks ma'am..."

The Chauffeur drove smartly and gently via the street routes. After about a few minutes, the Jeep halted in front of a huge mansion - one that I had never seen all my life!

" Here we go, this is my home...", She pointed.

' This is unbelievable! ', I thought.

"This is splendid!", I commented.

" Yeah it is. " She smiled.

We both alighted from the car where she led me to a huge black gate that spanned the entire width in my view.

She then remote-controlled the gate to open of which it  did.

" How's that? I've never seen that!", I echoed in awe and amazement.

" Well, that is how it works dear, you are yet to see alot more. " She replied with a beatific smile.

***

"Oh my good...!" I exclaimed with my hands over my mouth when she opened the extremely tall door to the lower sitting room. It was actually a storey building.

The sight of the extremely wide sitting room was a paradise to behold. It was six times wider than my lodge!

" You are going to staying here with me... ", She informed.

This was one in a million goodnews to me. I know I was not the kind that deserved something good.

' or is this woman a weirdo? ' I thought.

' why does she care so much about me? Is there anything special about me? ' My mind ran a marathon.

" Feel free my dear, this is your new home from now on... I promise you tomorrow, I'd take you to school." , She added.

This news was groundbreaking!

I could feel tears of joy flowing down my eyes.

" Thank you ma'am! I - I never dreamed this but you are making it happen. "
I knelt before her filled with tears.

" You don't have to do that dear, this is the only way I can restore that which I lost. ", She said with tears.

***
The following day, I was taken to a really splendid school by her. It was a really amazing school as opposed to the ones I saw back on the streets.

I was made to start from the very first year, ' Basic one ', since I had no previous academic records.

I was very much happy to have been so much honoured...
...
My very first day at school was a fulfillment of one of my utmost dreams. I had longed for this and here it was. What Andrella said few years back caught my memory.

God was actually restoring everything...
...
After school, the chauffeur came to pick me up from school. I was warmly welcomed by my new mom. I took my bath - after demonstrating novice character with the bathroom equipments, she invited me over to lunch.

I ate to stupor, the food was a delicacy!

" Sorry ma'am, what about your husband, did he travel? " I managed to ask.

Somehow, my question created a sinister atmosphere,

"He died last year..." She replied as tears rolled down her cheek.

"I am really sorry ma'am... My condolences", I consoled.

" So how about your family? "

"I don't know ma'am, I don't remember my very beginning. I - I only found myself on the streets..." I replied.

" Well, don't worry about that right now... I'm sure you are stressed out, you really need to rest okay, you can go to your room. " She suggested.

" Thank you ma'am..."

" You can call me 'mom' "

"Ma?"

"Yes, you can call me mom. "

"Okay ma... Okay mo- o -m" I pronounced hesitantly.

It was weird actually calling somebody mom, It's been long I last did that... I never did remember how my mom looked like afterall.

I resorted to my splendid room and reached for my newly acquired school bag.
I then flipped through the pages of my new textbooks...

I read through all the books in barely two hours and I could narrate the exact content of the textbooks.

It was so much easy for me to do.

At some point I felt like telling my forest experiences to my new mom.

' would she know anything about me if I do? ' I thought.

' or would she be able to trace my mom...?'
I thought.

" Good night sweetheart. " Her voiced rang through the door...

" Good night ...{hesitantly} mom ".
