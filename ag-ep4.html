      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 4</h2>
      <p>Overtime, I grew from strength to strength and from wisdom to wisdom.

      I always felt a greater force before and behind me that helped me survive the dreadful, monstrous and deadly forest.
      </p>

    <p>At nine, I had a near death experience.
    
      I've always been quiet all the time, my presence had never been noticed before but this time, I was rendered vulnerable.
      </p>

    <p>______</p>

    <p>It was a season of technology and science advancement when an helicopter flew above the forest.

     At it's distant sound I thought a monster or maybe the most dreadful of all monsters was on it's way.
     </p>

    <p>I ran to my hay and hid there.</p>

    <p>I watched from a distance how the helicopter spinned across.

I was very much impressed with the sight. I had a feeling that somehow, humans were mostly responsible for it.

I gently let go of the first helicopter as I sat in my hay thinking about it.</p>

    <p>Just then, I saw a dragon fly dangling in the air. I stared it closely and then compared it to what I had seen earlier.

    Many thoughts led to the other and I went as far as comparing it with birds.</p>

    <p>After sixteen days of meditating on what I had seen, I was able to deduce in my own primary experiment the reason why that thing could swim in air without falling.</p>

    <p>______</p>

    <p>After a few more days, I yearned to see the helicopter again. Luckily for me, I was able to.

       This time, when I heard the sound from a distance, I ran out of my hay towards the direction of the helicopter.
</p>
    <p>I shouted and screamed for help but nay, it went by. I lost it!

       Still with my eyes hung above the sky, facing the heavens and staring the direction it went.

      I brought my head back down but to my surprise, I saw myself staring a tiger!</p>

    <p>______</p>

    <p>I couldn't wait for it to start chasing, I ran for my dear life.

     The tiger took after me! I struggled through the forest and it chased too.

      I lounged through the forest trees and shrubs but it was just few meters behind me.</p>

    <p>I was almost giving up! I had concluded that my life was over at this point.

      To worsen the case, I slipped and fell!
       I had prepared myself for death. I found it hard to lift up myself again.</p>

     <p>______</p>

    <p>
      Fortunately and miraculously, the Tiger jumped over me. When I stretched forth my eyes to see what it was chasing, I realized that it was an antelope.

      I heaved a sigh of safety that sprawled the dry leaves on the ground. I dusted my worn out attires and headed for my hay.
    </p>

    <p>I couldn't trace my hay anymore! I remained amidst the forest wandering around and walking helter skelter.

       Yet with dreams, I found a solace there, at least I could lay my head. I hoped to dream dreams of another world as the sun went dark on me.</p>

    <p>At this point, I had lost the memory of my background. I only yearned for a better life.
</p>
     <p>I was a wasting genius!</p>
