      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode 7</h2>
      <pre class="story-content">
The following morning was preceded by my usual activities. At some point I could rate my fluency in speech.

The sun gradually rose from the valleys, I could sight how it gradually emerged upwards causing its heat to burn my skin tending a brighter color.

I was moved to seek hay, the sun was unmerciful!

After walking a few meters, I was able to sight a place I could shield myself some distance away. It appeared to have only a single problem.

I was supposed to cross the busy road to the actual place.

After making a chart of navigation in my head, I proceeded to crossover...

When I stepped my feet on the road, the next thing I realized was seeing myself soaked in water with alot of people gathered around me.

'What is going on here? ' I thought within myself.

'Thank God he is awake ', I overheard one say.

It was obvious that I had been hit by a car that left me unconscious. I never knew people could be so caring.

I recalled that in my own world, my mom alone cared about me. I never knew I'd hear somebody ask me... "Are you okay now?"

It was amazing to subvert the trauma of the cruelty of my then community. I wondered why they even cared. I thought love could only be bought.

I was again considerate of the statement made by one of the philanthropists,... `Thank God he is alive...`

' who was that that they had to thank him? ' , I thought.

' or was he the one that rescued me? ', I questioned my heart.

" I want to see Mr. God that rescued me and brought me to this place, I want to thank him. ", I informed.

The entire crowd shook at my words. Maybe they didn't know how to answer that so, I obviously got no reply from anybody.

After sometime, I was fully revived. The mode of the philanthropists were gone... Only a single young woman of about seventeen remained.

Even as she was made to go, my question... 'who is Mr. God ?' drew her back.

" I want to know him..., I want to thank him.", I added.

The young woman shook her head and posed a humble picture that made her appear beautiful.

"Please..." I pleaded.

"Hmmm..." She sighed.

I composed to hear what she had to say. Her facial expression revealed that she really had alot to say.

"He is a father...", she commenced.
"He lives..." She added.
"He's everywhere." She concluded.

She didn't even know what to say, she could only give me a Bible and a small tract titled... "Who is God...?"

"God be with you...", she said.
She then patted my back and left.

My heart was filled with a million questions...
