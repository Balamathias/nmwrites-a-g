      <h1>The Abandoned Genius</h1>
      <h2>Episode Two</h2>
    <p>Luckily enough for me, my mom stealthily whisked her footsteps behind them.</p>

    <p>She could target the exact place I was laid to die of starvation or probably to be devoured by wild beasts.</p>

    <p>It was dawn already, I could feel the gentle ruffle of her cold hands.</p>

    <p>She took me from the earth and embraced me. She wept and prayed me to survival.</p>

    <p>However, at this point, mom was up to risking her own life as the preceding consequence of her action appeared almost unbearable.</p>
    <p>I was only 15 days old when she hid me in a solitary cave.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, she could hear the quakes of a violent marching beast. She laid me in the cave, shrouded me with bullrushes and fled from being devoured.</p>

    <p>Mom also narrated her ordeals to Dad who insisted to let go of their misfortune.</p>

    <p>He referred to me as a "misfortune" but mom wouldn't listen.</p>

    <p>_______</p>
    <p>Time fled like eagles, days became months and months never spared becoming years.</p>

    <p>Mom kept on visiting and nursing me in the cave for five whole years!</p>

    <p>As fate could have it, I was seen by some of the renowned hunters of the time.</p>

    <p>When they sighted me from a distance, fear gripped them and they almost took to their heels.</p>

    <p>One of the bravest drew closer and closer to me while the rest watched from a distance.</p>

    <p>When they sensed that I wasn't violent, they all drew near.
    </p>
    <p>They asked what my name was and how I ended up here but my blue eyes spoke sense into their sanity.</p>

    <p>Just about at the same time, mom appeared with some food and water, as she always did. This time, they both came with Dad as he agreed to support her.</p>

    <p>It was a clash event, the hunters pointed their guns at them and they surrendered.</p>

   <p>"Oh, you! You had the guts to hide this monster child!"
     One pointed.</p>

    <p>"Please don't hurt him!" Mom screamed in tears.</p>

    <p>"Seize them!" The Chief hunter ordered.</p>

    <p>"We are taking them to the king!" He added.</p>

    <p>"And for the boy, the king will know what to do with him." He wrapped up.
</p>
    <p>_______</p>

    <p>At the palace, the king's dome, the king was so much aggressed towards what mom and Dad had done.
    </p>
     <p>He ruled out that mom and Dad be executed.</p>
    <p>The elders took counsel on this and agreed with the King.</p>

    <p>Daddy pleaded for mercy, he added that it'd be fine if they are exiled and never to return to the land.</p>
     <p>
      "Not with the child!" The King aggressively chimed in.
      </p>

    <p>The rest of the elders coincided as the King ruled out that if they must live to see the next day, they'd have to leave immediately.</p>

     <p>Although, this was a very difficult step for them to take, they were left without choice as they shove off the palace for their belongings.</p>

    <p>My Parents became the very first people to be ever banned from the land after the mercy of the King.</p>

     <p>I was then rendered to be executed.</p>

    <p>"How can we be sure that this wizard is not the one responsible for the death of the King's inlaws?"
One of the elders accused.</p>

    <p>The rest of them agreed... They accused me of mysteriously murdering those people. This was even enough reason for me to be executed.</p>

    <p>I was handed over to five valorous men of the community who took me to a serried monstrous forest.</p>

    <p>They also took their locally made ammunition with them to enhance their safety over wild beasts.</p>

    <p>As they marched with me through the forest to be executed, they heard strange sounds and steps.</p>

    <p>It was a wild beast that had been ruminating about the Forests.</p>

    <p>The brave men quaked at it's sight as it sped towards them. They abandoned me and fled for their lives.</p>

    <p>The beast took after them.
On seeing this, I sped into the denser forest with my short marching steps.</p>

    <p>________</p>

    <p>In the forest, at twilight, I could view how the sun set in the valleys.</p>

    <p>I could not hear the steps of mom. I couldn't feel her warm embrace and her lovely kisses and lullabies.</p>

    <p>At this point, a new phase had opened for me where I was to cater for myself!</p>

    <p>I was just five!</p>
